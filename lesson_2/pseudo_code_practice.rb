1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

casual write-up
    ask the user for one integer
    ask the user of a second integer
    created method that sums the two integers
    output result
    end program
    
formal write-up
    START program
    GET first integer from the user
    SET a variable to first integer input
    GET second integer from the user
    SET a variable to second integer input
    add to varibles together
    PRINT result
    END
    
2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those
    strings concatenated togther
    
casual write-up
    create an array of strings
    create a method that iterates over each string the in the array
    concatenate the strings together
    output resul

formal write-up
    START program
    SET a variable to an array full of strings
    GET strings in the array by iterating over the strings with .each method or loop
    concatenate strings in array
    PRINT result of concatenation
    END program


3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every
    other element
    
casual write-up
    create an array of integers and set it to a variable
    ieterate over the integers in the array and retrieve every other integer
    use the result of this to create another array and set it to a variable

formal write-up
    START program
    SET a variable to an array full of integers
    GET every other integer in the array by iterating over the array with .each or loop
    use the result of this to SET a varable to a new empty array and fill this new empty array with result
    PRINT new array with every other element
    END program
